# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## Project Description
This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis on the classic Titanic dataset. The goal is to discover patterns and insights into the factors influencing passenger survival. The analysis was conducted entirely in Python, with the core libraries Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization.

## Key Insights
The analysis revealed several key insights:
* **Survival Rate:** Less than 40% of passengers survived the tragedy.
* **Social Class:** Passengers in 1st Class had the highest survival rate, while passengers in 3rd Class had the lowest.
* **Gender:** Female passengers had a significantly higher probability of survival than male passengers.
* **Age:** Most passengers were in the productive age range (20-40 years old).
